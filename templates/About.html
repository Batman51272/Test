        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm <b>Syed Aown Raza</b>, a dedicated student with a strong passion for web development and programming. While I may not have formal job experience yet, I’ve built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have developed several projects using web frameworks like Django and the MERN stack.</p>
    
        <h3>My Skills</h3>
        <p>I have hands-on experience with the following technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
            <li><strong>Web Frameworks:</strong> Django, MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)</li>
            <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> C++, Python</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Projects and Experience</h3>
        <p>Although I haven’t yet worked professionally, I have completed various personal and academic projects that demonstrate my ability to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. These projects have helped me strengthen my problem-solving abilities and deepen my understanding of modern web development practices.</p>
    
        <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>
        <p>My journey into the world of technology began with learning C++ and Python, which laid the groundwork for my interest in web development. Over time, I expanded my knowledge to include front-end and back-end development, building full-stack applications with Django and the MERN stack. I'm constantly seeking new challenges to further hone my skills.</p>
        
        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p>I’m excited to continue learning and growing as a developer. I’m particularly interested in exploring advanced web development techniques, contributing to open-source projects, and collaborating with other developers on innovative projects.</p>
